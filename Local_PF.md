Despite the many attractive properties of PFs, they require an ensemble size that increases
exponentially with the dimension of the system. Serval strategies for overcoming the dimensionality challenges of PFs have been proposed recently.  The equal-weigts PF and the
implicit PF are drawing particles from a proposal density conditioned on the current observations. Another strategy, introduced in Reich, is to avoid the random sampling aspect of PFs by solving an optimal transportation problem for transforming prior particles into posterior particles.
