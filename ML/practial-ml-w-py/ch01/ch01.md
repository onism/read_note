# ch1: Machine Learning Basics

The core idea is to give us enough background on why we need ML, the fundamental building blocks of ML, and what ML offers us presently.

## The need for ML

### Making data-driven decisions

While getting insights and making decisions driven by data are of paramount importance, it also needs to be done with efficiency and at scale.

### Why ML?
The ML paradigm tries to take into account data and expected outputs or results if any and uses the computer to build the program, which is also known as a model.

## Important concepts

### scalar
A scalar usually denotes a single number

### Vector

### Matrix

### Tensor
Tensors are basically arrays with a variable number of axes.

### Norm

The norm is a measure that is used to compute the size of a vector often also defined as the measure of distance from the origin to the point denoted by the vector.

### Eigen Decomposition

## ML methods

Methods based on the amount of human supervision in the learning process
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning
3. semi-supervised learning
4. reinforcement learning

Methods based on the ability to learn from incremental data samples
1. batch learning
2. online learning

Methods based on their approach to generalization from data samples
1. Instance based learning
2. Model based learning

### supervised learning
1. classification
2. regression
