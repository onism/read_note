    Data Streaming with Affinity Propagation

This paper proposed StrAP, extending Affinity Propagation to data streaming. Several steps are made to build StrAP. The first one extends AP to weighted items with no loss of generality. The second one is concerned with reducing the quadratic AP complexity, by applying AP on data subsets and further applying weighted AP on the exemplars extracted from all subsets. Finally StrAP extends  Hierarchical WAP to deal with changes in the data distribution.
