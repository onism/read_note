# set-membership filter

    State estimation for ellipsoidally constrained dynamic systems with set-membership pseudo measurements

    Combined stochastic and setmembership information filtering in multisensor systems

In addition to the stochastic measurement noise, we further consider that the obtained measurement consists of an unknown but bounded error $e$, namely

\[
z = H x + v + e = \hat{z} + e    
\]

where the uncertainty of $e$ is confined to an ellipsoidal set as 

\[e \in \varepsilon(0,S) \]

With respect to the fact that the uniqueness of the measurement cannot be maintainded due to the uncertainty of $e$,  the set-membership measurement will be used.
