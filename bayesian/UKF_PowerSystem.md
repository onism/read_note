    Dynamic State Estimation for Multi-Machine Power System by Unscented Kalman Filter with Enhanced Numerical Stability

State estimation is an important application of the energy management system (EMS).

Bothe EKF and UKF can suffer from the curse of dimensionality and effect of dimensionality may become detrimental in high-dimensional state space models with state-vectors of size twenty or more, especially when there are high degree of nonlinearities in the equations that describe the state space model.
