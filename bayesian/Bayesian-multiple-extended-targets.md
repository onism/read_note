A Bayesian Approach to Track Multiple Extended
Targets using Particle Filter for Nonlinear System

    ref: A Bayesian Approach to Track Multiple Extended
    Targets using Particle Filter for Nonlinear System

To track multiple extended targets for the nonlinear system, this paper employs the idea of the particle filtering to jointly estimate the measurement-target data association and states of the extended targets. 

Note: It is too difficult. The PHD filter and JPDA perform better than it (I think).
