# Semi-infinite Programming

Semi-infinite programming (SIP) problems are optimization problems in which there is an infinite number of variables or an infinite number of constraints. A general SIP problem can be formulated as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_x f(x)   \\
\text{subject to} \qquad g(x,t) >= 0, \forall t \in T
\end{aligned}
$$
